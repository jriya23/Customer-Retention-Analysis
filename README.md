## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
### 🔹 Python Analysis  
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/jriya23/Customer-Retention-Analysis/blob/main/Churn%20Customer.ipynb
2. Install required Python libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3. Open `Churn_Customer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.  

### 🔹 Power BI Dashboard  
1. Open `Churn_Analysis_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI.  
2. Interact with the dashboard to explore insights.  

## 📢 Key Insights & Recommendations  
🔹 **High Churn Rate**: Customers with lower engagement and longer subscription durations are more likely to churn.  
🔹 **Demographic Influence**: Certain age groups and customer segments show higher churn rates.  
🔹 **Retention Strategies**: Personalized offers and better customer engagement can reduce churn.  

## 📜 Conclusion  
By leveraging Python for in-depth analysis and Power BI for visualization, this project provides actionable insights to reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies.
